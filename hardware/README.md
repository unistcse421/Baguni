# Baguni
Here is a hardware part of the Baguni. The paper-box shaped prototype provides just basic features. It is connected with the back-end of Baguni and provides delivering the goods for the user. Since we don't have enough budget, we used out-of-dated device or cost-optimized(?) solution.

## Circuit
(TBA)

## Dependency
Since we will use out-of-dated device, here is some dependency issue.
- Target Device: KTTech EV-S100 (Android Gingerbread device)
- Development Environment: Processing-3.0a11 with AndroidMode-0239
