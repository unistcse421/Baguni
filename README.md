# Baguni

BAGUNI is vending machine service you have probably never seen before. This awesome service provides you a new peer-to-peer trading method on the campus. It is the service of a so-called ‘trading-on-demand’. You need not to decide the place and time when you purchase any goods from other people. Since the deliver put their goods into BAGUNI, – the name of our vending machine – you can take them anytime you want.

Even if there are no items what you want to buy, you can request the goods to the deliver by using BAGUNI. We provides the matching system for your and deliver’s needs. If you are registered as a deliver, you can start your own business without funding!

Trading and taking-on-demand
Matching system for consumer and deliverer
Payment and authentication at the same time (by using transportation card)
…Simply, Let’s assume that we are in the situation something like this:

We love Bongoose rice burger and McDonalds great hamburger but they doesn’t deliver the foods. Sometimes we need Emart products. However, they are too far from the campus. It is too inefficient to visit there. Some students posted their advertisement on Facebook but it is not continuous delivery service. What if there is some awesome platform for deliverer and consumers?

The answer is BAGUNI!
